# Chapter 6 Exploring the adaptability and robustness of *M. pneumoniae* central carbon metabolism

Supplementary material, code and figures for chapter 6.
All *omics* data, modeling files as well as a backup of modeling pipeline and simulation outputs are available via the Seek data and model management platform for maximum reproducibility 
(http://doi.org/10.15490/FAIRDOMHUB.1.INVESTIGATION.133.3) 
Note, even with all available data on Seek, the data is at most FAir, meaning that all data is Searchable and Accessible, but interoperability and re-usability is limited. The reason for this is simple, the linkage of data and protocols was not done by the original experimentalists at the time of generation but by me a data analyst and modeler not involved in generation of most the data. In some cases it is not 100% clear which protocols was used. This is unfortunate but it is simply the limitations of historical data and FAIRification of data.
In my opinion, truly FAIR data is only achievable when using a "FAIR by design" approach. FAIR by design means that all data is standardized in experimental setup, conditions, annotation, data formats and meta-data.

# PhD_Thesis
This GitHub repository contains all Supplementary files for the chapters in the PhD thesis "Patterns in pathogenesis:  Elucidating bacterial host interaction", to be defended in Wageningen on 05-12-2022.
Each Chapter from this thesis dissertation has its own sub-directory, with Supplementary files, code and figures where applicable. Although some code might be specific for the data used, or hard to interpret without toy data, by providing it here we increase teh chance this code will not become 'one time use code'. Providing the data with the original code was unfortunately not possible due to size constrains, but the code can in general regenereate such data files.

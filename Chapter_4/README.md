# Chapter 4  Phenotype and multi-omics comparison of *Staphylococcus* and *Streptococcus* uncovers pathogenic traits and predicts zoonotic potential
Supplementary files are provided here for convenience but are part of the BMC Genomics publication:
"Phenotype and multi-omics comparison of *Staphylococcus* and *Streptococcus* uncovers pathogenic traits and predicts zoonotic potential"
Supplementary material is provided by BMC Genomics on:

Note, I provide the code here which is was part of the supplementary material of the published article in the hope parts of it might be reused.

Providing the data with the code was unfortunately not possible due to size constrains, but in general all intermediate data files can be regenerated as long as one has the genomes sequences annotated by SAPP.
The list of selected genomes provided in the supplementary material can be used to download the genomes using the ENA browser tool and annotation using the SAPP Semantic Annotation Pipeline.
For more details read the Material and methods from the publication in BMC Genomics.
